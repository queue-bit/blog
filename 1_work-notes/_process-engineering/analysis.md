### Interview Gamification

#### Speedboat (teams)
- Easy and silly little "game" that can be used to discover what's slowing down human processes vs. what's speeding them up
- Draw a sailboat on water, with an anchor
- Invite the target group to add post-it notes:
  - Below the water for things that are slowing them down
  - Above the water for things that are speeding them up
