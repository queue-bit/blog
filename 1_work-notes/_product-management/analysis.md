### Interview and Brainstorming Gamification

See [gamestorming.com](https://gamestorming.com) for an excellent list of games, these are some I've used and had success with.

#### Speedboat

- Easy and silly little "game" that can be used to discover what's slowing down human processes vs. what's speeding them up
- Draw a sailboat on water, with an anchor
- Invite the target group to add post-it notes:
  - Below the water for things that are slowing them down
  - Above the water for things that are speeding them up 

#### Pain and Gain

For a specific person, role, or persona

1. Draw the person on a sheet/whiteboard
1. Ask the group to answer the following as that person and capture the responses on the left side of the drawing:
   * What keeps you up at night?
   * What does a bad day look like for you?
   * What are you responsible for?
   * What are you afraid of?
1. Then ask the group to answer the following as that person and capture the responses on the right side of the drawing:
   * How do you measure success?
   * What can we offer you?
   * What do you aspire to?
   * How could you benefit?
