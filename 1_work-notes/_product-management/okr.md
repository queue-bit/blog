### Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

A goal-setting framework and leadership tool that specifies what you want to accomplish and the milestones needed to reach those goals.

> I will (Objective) as measured by (set of Key Results)  
> _- John Doerr "Measure what Matters"_  

OKR's must be visible to entire organization, every team and team member should be able to see the big-picture.

**Objectives:**

- Are aspirational
- Set a clear direction
- Motivate team to achieve it
- Must be ambitious 
- Aim for 1-3 objectives per team
- There needs to be time limits for a goal to matter

**Key Results:**

- Are a metric and target value
- Show that we're moving in the right direction
- Allow us to see how far we've come and how far we have to go
- Aim for 1-3 Key Results per Objective

**Frequencies:**

- Set every quarter
- Report on frequently
- It's not expected to reach 100% of your targets
  - 70% should be realistic
  - 100% would be everyone exceeding expectations, shouldn't happen often
