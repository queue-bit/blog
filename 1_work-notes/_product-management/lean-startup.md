### Lean Startup

The idea is to spend more time on things that produce value by reducing the time spent on unneeded practices, focus on the business model instead of trying to value the product. In this sense, experimentation trumps detailed planning, you want to hypothesize, experiment, and fail fast.

#### Hypothesis Driven Experimentation and Validated Learning

Realistically you should only develop products that consumers already want, don't create a product and then chase for consumers/market-fit. This means you need to learn about your customers and their problems as early as possible and test your assumptions.

Typically in the form of:

1. Identify the problem that needs solving
2. Create a hypothesis
3. Create experiment to validate your hypothesis/assumptions
4. Develop MVP (your experiment)
5. Get feedback from users
6. Iterate

This is what we mean when we say "fail fast", you want to spend as little time/resources as possible to test your hypothesis before going all-in.
