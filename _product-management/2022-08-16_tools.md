## User Journeys


### [edit.org](https://edit.org/blog/free-customer-journey-map-templates) 

- Good selection of online-editable templates.


### [userinterviews.com](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/best-customer-journey-map-templates-examples) 

- Good write-up with downloadable templates


## Wireframe Tools

### [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)

- Commercial License.
- Great for wireframing different user experiences.
- Easy to use.

## Usability Testing & User Interview Tools

### [Lookback](https://www.lookback.com/)

- Commercial License.
- Service that allows you to track participants navigating your apps/websites while interviewing them.
- Incredibly easy to use but powerful way to gain real insight into what users are thinking.
- Requires that you find your own testers/users.


## Documentation Tools

### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Free
- Primarily a code editor, however, it has many plugins for working with markdown and markup languages and integrates well with git, making it well suited for writing 
and maintaining documentation as code.

### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

- Knowledge Base that uses markdown files.
- Allows for back-linking documents together to create an extremely powerful graph view.
- Extendable using extensions.

### [Github](https://www.github.com)

- Commercial License.
- I'm including Github in Documentation Tools because it can be an incredible document repository if the team takes the time to learn git source control. Used in conjunction with markdown languages and publishing tools/integrations, git can be incredibly useful for versioning control.
